This fork of [dhoub/multi-semantic-release](https://github.com/dhoulb/multi-semantic-release) replaces [`setImmediate` loops](https://github.com/dhoulb/multi-semantic-release/blob/561a8e66133d422d88008c32c479d1148876aba4/lib/wait.js#L13) 
and [`execa.sync` hooks](https://github.com/dhoulb/multi-semantic-release/blob/561a8e66133d422d88008c32c479d1148876aba4/lib/execaHook.js#L5) with event-driven flow and finally makes possible to run the most release operations in parallel.
